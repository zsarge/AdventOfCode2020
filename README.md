I am doing AdventOfCode as a fun exercise in programming, not to get a high score.

## Solution Overview

| Day | Language   | Comments                                                                          |

| 1   | Javascript | This is a very inefficient solution. Still only takes ~0.519s                     |
| 2   | C          | On my system, this solution takes 0.011s. Unsurprisingly, C beats JS              |
| 3   | Ruby       | This was me experimenting with OOP. I have not used Ruby in a while.              |
| 4   | Python     | This took me two hours because I had a typo in two characters.                    |
| 5   | Javascript | I tried to do this one from challenge open. I placed somewhere under the top 970. |
