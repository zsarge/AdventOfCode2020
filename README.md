I am a high schooler doing Advent of Code as a fun exercise in programming, not a professional programmer attempting to get a high score.

I am trying to do each day in a different programming language, but I don't have much of a real plan.

## Solution Overview

|                         Day                          |                                     Solutions                                      | Language   |                 Details                 | Comments                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------- | :-------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       [1](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)       |                 [Pt 1](day01/day1.js), [Pt 2](day01/day1_part2.js)                 | Javascript |         [link](day01/README.md)         | This is a very inefficient solution, but it still only takes ~0.519s                    |
|       [2](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)       |                  [Pt 1](day02/day2.c), [Pt 2](day02/day2_part2.c)                  | C          |         [link](day02/README.md)         | On my system, this solution takes 0.011s. Unsurprisingly, C beats JS                    |
|       [3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)       |                             [Pts 1 & 2](day03/day3.rb)                             | Ruby       |         [link](day03/README.md)         | This was me experimenting with OOP. I have not used Ruby in a while.                    |
|       [4](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)       |                [Pt 1](day04/day04.py), [Pt 2](day04/day04_part2.py)                | Python     |         [link](day04/README.md)         | This took me two hours because I had a typo in two characters.                          |
| [5 (original)](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5)  | [Pt 1](day05/day05_original/day05.js), [Pt 2](day05/day05_original/day05_part2.js) | Javascript | [link](day05/day05_original/README.md)  | I tried to do this one from challenge open. I placed 8460 in part 1 and 8816 in part 2. |
| [5 (optimized)](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5) |                    [Pts 1 & 2](day05/day05_optimized/day05.go)                     | Go         | [link](day05/day05_optimized/README.md) | After realizing how bad my original solution was, I improved it in Go.                  |
|       [6](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6)       |                [Pt 1](day06/day6.php), [Pt 2](day06/day6_part2.php)                | PHP        |                                         | This is my first time using PHP. I thought I would hate it more, but it's alright.      |

Out of all my solutions, I am most happy with Day 2, and Day 5 (optimized).

My friend Kevin is also doing Advent of Code, all in Javascript.
