# AdventOfCode2020

## https://adventofcode.com/2020/

I am doing AdventOfCode as a fun exercise in programming, not to get a high score.

I am trying to do each day in a different programming language, but I don't have much of a real plan.

## Solution Overview

|                         Day                          |                                                                                          Solutions                                                                                           | Language   | Comments                                                                                |

Still only takes ~0.519s                           |

Unsurprisingly, C beats JS                    |

I have not used Ruby in a while.                    |

I placed 8460 in part 1 and 8816 in part 2. |
